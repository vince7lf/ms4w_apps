  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set consists of federally owned land polygon features of 
      the United States.  The data set was created by extracting federal 
      land polygon features from the individual 1:2,000,000-scale State 
      boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced by the U.S. Geological 
      Survey.  These files were then appended into a single coverage.  This is a 
      revised version of the June 1998 data set.  There may be private
      inholdings within the boundaries of Federal Lands in this data set.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. 
      No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of 
      these data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's Arc/INFO GIS software, the data set was checked for label 
    errors, dangling nodes, and intersections.  Polygon topology was built for 
    the data set using the "BUILD" command.
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The accuracy of the Digital Line Graphs was tested by one or more of the 
      following methods: 1) manual comparison of the source with hard copy 
      plots, 2) symbolized display of the digital line graph on an interactive 
      computer graphic system, 3) selected attributes that could not be visually 
      verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on 
      screen.  The DLG files were directly converted to Arc/INFO coverages, so 
      attributes have not been checked in the Arc/INFO format.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes federal land polygon features for all 50 of the 
    United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
    Islands.  The minimum map resolution is 640 acres or one square mile. 
    Generally, features under this size are not shown.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        In DLG format, files underwent comparison to a graphic source or image 
        source to assess digital positional accuracy.  During conversion to 
        Arc/INFO coverage format and the process to append the States together, 
        node snapping and fuzzy tolerances may have caused minimal positional 
        shifts.

      Process_Description:
        The 2MILBD files were originally digitized by the National Mapping 
        Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of 
        the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The
        sectional maps were updated during 1978-1981 and digitized in the early 
        1980's.  The data were updated in 1995 using 1:1,000,000-scale and 
        1:2,000,000-scale BLM state base maps.  These data were published on CD-
        ROM in 1995 as State tiles in DLG optional format.  Using Arc/INFO 
        software, the updated DLG optional format files were converted to 
        Arc/INFO coverages using the DLGARC command.  The numeric DLG attribute 
        codes were translated to their text equivalents.  For example, the DLG 
        code '097 0363' was translated to 'National Park NPS'.  Only land and 
        attribute information were extracted for inclusion.  Proper names were 
        added to specific Federal lands.  The States were then paneled together 
        with the APPEND command.  "Slivers" created during the paneling process
        were identified and deleted using the ELIMINATE command.  The attribute 
        AGBUR, which contains the name of the owning or administering agency or 
        bureau, was added for plotting purposes.  The data were converted to 
        shapefile format for use in National Atlas applications and for 
        distribution to the public.

        In 1998, topological errors introduced when the State files were paneled 
        were corrected.  Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was added.
        Coding of Lake Tahoe was corrected, and Fort Frederica, GA was deleted 
        because it was smaller than the minimum area of 640 acres.

      Process_Description:
        Several new federal lands were established since 1998.  Those that meet 
        the minimum mapping criterion of 640 acres (1 square mile) were added.  
        They are: 
        >1) Headwaters Forest Reserve, California (Bureau of Land Management)
        >2) Tall Grass Prairie National Preserve, Kansas (National Park Service) 
        >3) Opal Creek Wilderness, Oregon (Forest Service)

        >   Monument
        >8) Agua Fria National Monument, California (Bureau of Land Management) 
        >9) California Coastal National Monument, California (Bureau of Land
        >   Management)
        >10) Sequoia National Monument, California (Forest Service)
        >11) Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Colorado (Bureau of Land
        >    Management)
        >12) Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, Arizona (Bureau of Land
        >    Management)  
        >13) Ironwood Forest National Monument, Arizona (Bureau of Land
        >    Management)
        >14) Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, Oregon (Bureau of Land 
        >    Management)
        >15) Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area, Colorado (Bureau of Land 
        >    Management) 
        >16) Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife Refuge, Vermont (Fish and
        >    Wildlife Service)

        Data sets were obtained from the State, regional, or field offices of
        the federal agencies which own or administer the newly created lands.  
        The data were re-projected, generalized, and integrated into the 
        existing federal lands data set.  Hanford Reach National Monument, 
        Washington (Fish and Wildlife Service) and the expansion of Pinnacles 
        National Monument (National Park Service) are not included in this 
        release.  The California Coastal National Monument consists of thousands 
        of Bureau of Land Management-administered islands, rocks, exposed reefs, 
        and pinnacles above high mean tide, within twelve nautical miles of the 
        shoreline, between Oregon and Mexico.  The National Monument is shown in 
        the Federal Lands data set as a polygon which encloses this area. 

        All National Park Service lands in the existing Federal Lands data set
        were reviewed using a national boundary coverage, NPS-BND99.  Some
        adjustments were made to resolve discrepancies between National Park 
        Service data and existing National Atlas boundary data.

        An inventory of all wilderness areas was conducted in cooperation with 
        the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute.  Wildernesses that were 
        missing and that were larger than the minimum map resolution of 640 
        acres were acquired from the State, regional, or field offices of the 
        land-owning agencies.  The data sets were re-projected, generalized, and 
        integrated into the existing Federal Lands data set.  Newly established 
        wilderness areas were also acquired and integrated into the data set.  
        Eighty-six wilderness areas were added as a result of this effort.  

        The accuracy of wilderness names was reviewed in cooperation with the 
        Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute.  Name changes were made to 
        resolve misspellings or incorrectly named features.
  
        Wilderness area boundaries in Arizona, California, New Mexico, and 
        Colorado were reviewed and, in some cases, re-aligned.  Arizona 
        wilderness areas and wilderness study areas managed by the Bureau of 
        Land Management (BLM), the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest 
        Service, and National Park Service were reviewed with AZ-WLD90.  
        California wilderness areas managed by the BLM were reviewed using 
        Information the Sacramento office.  Colorado wildernesses and wilderness 
        study areas were reviewed with CO-WLD00 and CO-WSA00, respectively.  New 
        Mexico wilderness areas were reviewed with NM-WLD97, which includes 
        wilderness areas managed by the BLM, Fish and Wildlife Service, the 
        Forest Service, and the National Park Service.

        An inventory of National Wildlife Refuges was conducted to ensure 
        completeness of refuge data.  Fifteen new refuges were added using data 
        sets from regional or field offices of the Fish and Wildlife Service.  
        Five additional refuges that meet the minimum mapping resolution of 640 
        acres could not be included because data were not available. 

        Military installations were reviewed with respect to base closure data 
        provided by the Department of Defense Environmental Cleanup Office on 
        their website (<http://www.dtic.mil/envirodod/>).  Installations that
        have closed or are scheduled to close have a notation after the
        installation name; for example: Loring Air Force Base (Closed);  Kelly
        Air Force Base (Scheduled to close).

        Several Army Corps of Engineer lakes were reviewed with 1:100,000 scale 
        topographic maps.  Approximately 70 shorelines were adjusted.

        In 1998, the National Atlas of the United States published a 1:7,500,00 
        scale map of Federal and Indian Lands.  Corrections made in the 
        preparation of this map were incorporated into the Federal Lands polygon 
        data set.  Approximately 60 corrections were made.  They included name 
        changes, spelling corrections, and addition and deletion of lands.
 
        Several lands were deleted that were incorrectly attributed as 
        Wilderness Study Areas.  They are: Book Cliffs Instant Study Area, Utah;
        Devils Garden Natural Area, California; Blue Range Primitive Area,
        Arizona; and Joshua Tree National Landmark, Utah.

        The two Veterans Administration Hospitals that had been included in the 
        data were deleted.  Although they had met the minimum mapping 
        resolution of 640 acres, they were not the largest Veterans
        Administration in terms of capacity (number of beds).  A determination
        will be made whether or not to include Veterans Administration 
        hospitals prior to the next release of the data.

        Digital Line Graph data that had not been complete at the time of the 
        first release were incorporated into the data set. 

        The attributes were reorganized to better represent multi-coded 
        features.  In general, polygons which represent two or more feature 
        classes, where one feature class is contained in another (e.g. a 
        wilderness area inside a forest), have the smaller or 'contained' 
        feature as Feature1 and the larger feature as Feature2.  Similarly, the 
        feature referenced as Feature3 will contain the land in Feature2.

        Approximately 500 new URL addresses were added to link Federal Land 
        features to agency websites.
