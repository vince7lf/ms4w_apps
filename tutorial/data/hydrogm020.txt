  Description:
    Abstract:
      The data set portrays the polygon and line water features of the United 
      States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The file was produced 
      by joining the individual State hydrography layers from the 1:2,000,000-
      scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data produced by the USGS.  This is a
      revised version of the March 1999 data set. 
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of
      these data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The 2MILHY data files were originally digitized by the National Mapping 
        Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of 
        the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The
        1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a 
        single national hydrography coverage.  Where necessary to effect the 
        merge, alignment changes were made.  The names were taken from the USGS
        1:100,000-scale base maps.  For Alaska, the names were taken from the 
        1:250,000-scale sheets.  State lines across water bodies were removed 
        from the national coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the
        features.

        Some spatial features were added and corrected.  Some name attributes

        Extra spaces were removed from the attributes.  Hydrographic features 
        for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added.
